 MARIBYRNONG CARAVAN DATASET — GAUGE NETWORK SUMMARY
 ausvic extension | 12 gauges | updated Feb 2026
================================================================================

Caravan submission: https://github.com/kratzert/Caravan/issues/51
Zenodo DOI:         https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18736844
Streamflow units:   mm/day (converted from ML/day ÷ catchment area km²)
Catchment areas:    HydroATLAS UP_AREA (GEE polygon intersection method),
                    except Keilor (230200) which uses the official Victorian
                    Water figure of 1305.4 km² (586 gaugings 1908–2025).

================================================================================
 EXCLUDED STATIONS
================================================================================

3 stations excluded — already present in Caravan via CAMELS AUS v2
(Zenodo 13350616, checked Feb 2026):
  230210  Jacksons Creek at Bullengarook  (CAMELS period 1968–2022)
  230205  Deep Creek at Bulla             (CAMELS period 1955–2022)
  230209  Barringo Creek at Barringo      (CAMELS period 1966–2020)

2 stations excluded — agency duplicates (same physical gauge as a Hydstra
station; Hydstra record kept because it is substantially longer):
  230104A  Jacksons Creek at Sunbury Road, Sunbury
           Co-located with Hydstra gauge 230202 (~10 m separation). 230104A
           is the Melbourne Water agency ID; 230202 is the Victorian Water /
           Hydstra ID. 230202 kept: record from 1960 vs 1996 (36-year longer).
           Source: Oct 2022 post-event flood analysis named it "Jacksons Creek
           at Sunbury Road" — confirming it is NOT on the mainstem.
  230105A  Maribyrnong River at Keilor (Melbourne Water ID)
           Same physical crump weir as Hydstra 230200. BOM assigns this station
           the MW ID 230105A; Victorian Water uses 230200. 230200 kept: record
           from 1907 vs 1996 (89-year longer record).

1 station excluded — reservoir (not a streamflow gauge):
  230103A  Rosslynne Reservoir
           The Melbourne Water API flags this site as a reservoir recording
           (reservoirRecording = true). Reservoir inflows/outflows are managed
           releases, not natural streamflow, and are not suitable for Caravan.

2 stations excluded — record too short (started 2025, <1 year of data):
  230232A  Deep Creek at Bolinda        (flow from 2025)
  230233A  Jacksons Creek at Gisborne WWTP (flow from 2025)
           Both gauges are newly commissioned (as of early 2025). Insufficient
           record length for meaningful climate-index computation or ML training.
           230233A is also downstream of a wastewater treatment plant, introducing
           non-natural flow components. Re-evaluate for inclusion in future updates.

3 stations excluded — no flow data (level-recording only or weather station):
  230206C  Jacksons Ck DS Rosslynne Res — no discharge data
  230204B  Riddells Creek at Riddells Creek — no discharge data
  230810A  Sunbury Tanks AWS      — automated weather station, no streamflow

1 station excluded — minimal flow / uncharacterisable:
  230236A  Keilor East — detected 2.3 ML/day during Oct 2022 major flood peak
           (the largest Maribyrnong flood since 1974). Flow too small and
           catchment area unknown; insufficient for Caravan hydrological
           characterisation. Likely a minor overflow channel or local drain
           near Keilor East suburb rather than a named watercourse gauge.

   Lat / Lon   : -37.6314, 144.8010
   Area        : 876.1 km² (HydroATLAS UP_AREA, GEE point lookup)
   Flow from   : 2004-01-01
   Role        : Junction gauge capturing combined Deep Creek + Emu Creek
                 flows before entering the Maribyrnong mainstem. Closes the
                 water balance gap between Darraweit Guim (682.7 km²) and
                 Keilor (1305.4 km²). Oct 2022 peak: 98 m³/s.
   Note        : The Melbourne Water /summary API does not expose flowLevels
                 for this station. Flow confirmed via direct API query over

   Area        : 177.9 km²
   Flow from   : 2008-01-01
   Role        : Upper Bolinda Creek tributary. Despite being 45% smaller than
                 Jacksons Creek, provided similar flood flow in Oct 2022 due
                 to Emu Creek arm and high antecedent wetness.

   Role        : Konagaderra Creek tributary entering mid Maribyrnong.

6. ausvic_230237 | Maribyrnong River at Keilor North  *** ADDED Feb 2026 ***
   Station ID  : 230237A
   Lat / Lon   : -37.6778, 144.8050
   Area        : 1413.8 km² (HydroATLAS — Level-12 resolution snaps Keilor North,
                 Keilor, and Chifley Drive to the same outlet basin; true catchment
                 is likely 900–1200 km² but no finer estimate is available)
   Flow from   : 2008-01-01
   Role        : Junction gauge downstream of Jacksons Creek confluence,
                 in Sydenham Park. Captures combined mainstem + Jacksons
                 Creek flows. Sits between Sunbury (406.7 km²) and Keilor
                 (1305.4 km²). Used in official MW flood warning operations.
   Note        : The Melbourne Water /summary API does not expose flowLevels
                 for this station. Flow confirmed via direct API query over

7. ausvic_230106 | Maribyrnong River at Chifley Drive
   Station ID  : 230106A
   Lat / Lon   : -37.7659, 144.8950
   Area        : 1413.6 km²
   Flow from   : 1996-01-01
   Role        : Lower mainstem, tidal zone. Flow only reliable above ~1 m
                 water level (>16,520 ML/day). Only 263 valid flow days on
                 record. 3rd highest stage on record in Oct 2022 (4.22 m).
                 Highest recorded: 4.50 m (September 1906).
   AEP levels  : Minor 1.70 m (20% AEP), Major 2.90 m, 1% AEP = 4.40 m
                 (source: Maribyrnong Municipal Storm and Flood Emergency
                 Plan v4.0, Oct 2018, Appendix C1).

   Tidal limitation and flood prediction (note for residents near Chifley Drive)
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   On most days, tidal backwater masks the river signal — this gauge is
   essentially a tide gauge except during major flood events. The 263 valid
   flow days provide sparse ML training data, so a model trained on this gauge
   alone would have limited skill at predicting "normal" runoff behaviour.

   However, the events that actually matter for residents — major floods — DO
   produce stage well above the tidal threshold, so those events ARE captured
   in the training record. The Oct 2022 flood (4.22 m) is included.

   For practical flood prediction near Chifley Drive, the primary leading
   indicator is Keilor (230200), located ~5 km upstream. Keilor has records
   from 1907, a well-constrained catchment area (1305.4 km²), and is the
   gauge used by Melbourne Water and emergency services for flood watch.
   The Maribyrnong Municipal Storm and Flood Emergency Plan (2018) explicitly
   links Keilor stage levels to downstream inundation severity. The addition
   of 230102A (Deep Creek at Bulla) and 230237A (Keilor North) to this dataset
   improves upstream catchment coverage and should strengthen ML model
   skill at predicting the flood peak that arrives at Chifley Drive.

8. ausvic_230200 | Maribyrnong River at Keilor
   Station ID  : 230200
   Lat / Lon   : -37.727706, 144.836476
   Area        : 1305.4 km² (official Victorian Water figure)
   Flow from   : 1907-05-20
   Role        : Primary long-record mainstem gauge. Artificial crump weir;
                 586 gaugings 1908–2025. Longest record in the network.
                 Oct 2022: 768 m³/s (highest since 1974, just above 2% AEP).
   Note        : BOM also assigns this station ID 230105A (same physical gauge,
                 different agency system). We use the Hydstra/DELWP number.
                 The MW duplicate (230105A) is excluded — see Excluded section.

† area_km2 for ausvic_230237: HydroATLAS Level-12 snaps Keilor North, Keilor, and
  Chifley Drive to the same outlet basin — all three return ~1413 km². True
  catchment for 230237A is smaller (likely 900–1200 km²) but no finer estimate
  is available. 230200 uses the official VW figure (1305.4 km²) instead.

‡ ausvic_230106 (Chifley Drive): tidal zone gauge. Only 263 valid flow days on
  record — see tidal limitation note in the gauge entry above.

§ ausvic_230119 (Lancefield): flow-start date TBD — /summary API does not expose
  flowLevels for this station. Area confirmed as 349.2 km² (GEE Step 4, Feb 2026).
  Flow start will be confirmed when fetch_maribyrnong.py fetches the full record.
